## About

This is a way to look at Local Storage when the storage is being encrypted with [LZString.js](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string).  Also
might be useful since it pretty prints JSON (double click on any row to get the Pretty Printed value).  Very feature bare, banged
out in a couple of hours as a tool I needed.
